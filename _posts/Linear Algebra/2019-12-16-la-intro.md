### Linear Algebra #1 Introduction

By definition, Linear Algebra was started to solve **the simultaneous equation** (or linear equation) easily.

For example, in the linear equation  x + 4y = 3, we have to find the values of x and y that satisfy 3 which is the solution in the right hand side(RHS).

However, it is difficult to find the unknown when the amount of equations is less than the amount of unknown.

If the equation of **same dimension** exists one more, we can find the solution easily through the relationship between two equations. It is the purpose why we study Linear Algebra. *Linearity means the result is influenced as the input is influenced in the system*. In other words, the system can be predicted.  

For example, the linear equation y = ax, the result will be come out as y is multiplied by a even though x is multiplied by any number.

Define the linearity as the equation,

In (1), the equation y = 2x, y is 6 when x is 3. And then remove the coefficient 2 of x and multiply y by 2. 2y = x and the result is same as y is 6 when x is 3.

In (2), the equation y = a(x1+x2) = a(x1) + a(x2), when x1 = 2, x2 = 3 and a =4,
the result is same as 20 by y = 4(2+3) = 4(2) + 4(3).

Therefore, this is linearity. The result can be predicted by the coefficient of the input from above. 

And Algebra means “the letter which replaces number”. We call Algebra which is to get solution by solving equations using algebra. In the linear equation y = 2x, algebra are x and y and 2 is the coefficient of algebra, which has an important meaning in Linear Algebra. We will get the solution of simultaneous equation using these coefficient.

In other words, Linear Algebra is the study or the methodology that get the solution by the equation of algebra which has linearity.

In addition, it is possible to direct a number of calculation to computer by at least typing if we use the equation and the calculation technique of Linear Algebra. Therefore, Linear Algebra is the base of **Machine Learning**. Machine Learning performs the complex calculation using a number of data which the computer can understand such as a number fundamentally.

Also, Linear Algebra is the study of matrix and vector. Matrix is the key of every application.

e.g.) export 6 products to the USA, Ecuador and the UK.

First row, 3 products for the USA, 2 for Ecuador and 1 for the UK.

Even we can use matrix for the strategy simulation game or RPG game by getting the optimized result in limited source like the scenario. So we can see the versatility of Linear Algebra.

The vector plane is actually the beginning of Linear Algebra.
