Vectors, Geometry and Linear Algebra 

By definition, Linear Algebra was started to solve the simultaneous equation (or linear equation) easily.

For example, in the linear equation  x + 4y = 3, we have to find the values of x and y that satisfy 3 which is the solution in the right hand side(RHS).

However, it is difficult to find the unknown when the amount of equations is less than the amount of unknown.

If the equation of same dimension exists one more, we can find the solution easily through the relationship between two equations. It is the purpose why we study Linear Algebra. Linearity means the result is influenced as the input is influenced in the system. In other words, the system can be predicted.  

For example, the linear equation y = ax, the result will be come out as y is multiplied by a even though x is multiplied by any number.

Define the linearity as the equation,
