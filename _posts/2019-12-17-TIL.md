>17/12/2019/ TIL(Today I Learnt) :(

# What I did today
- I studied Real Analysis and Calculus(function) Instruction and part 1 a bit.<br>
  [RAC(fun) Intro](https://takealook00.github.io/real%20analysis%20and%20calculus(fun)/RAC-1/)
 
# What I felt today
- I did not follow the plan I made yesterday..I feel guilty.
  Actually, I did not have enough time to study today and I also felt quite blue.
  However, it is the second day after I started TIL. Therefore, I decided to study as possible.
  (Actually, I am writing TIL today over the midnight...)
  
- It is possible to write mathematical equations in the Google Doc. I can use LaTeX a bit
  but I am a beginner and even though I used LaTeX, I should upload image of it for uploading it on github. 
  Maybe I can write them directly to github.
 
- I still feel unfamiliar with Cartesian Product even I have looked at it several times.
  Also, I must remember the mathematical notations!!!

- In designing the github blog, I feel quite confused. 
  For example, the headings sometimes work but not always.
  In addition, the theme was applied to my post page when I deleted the code `layout: post`.
  

# What to do tomorrow
- To study Real Analysis and Calculus (functions) part 1 as possible.
