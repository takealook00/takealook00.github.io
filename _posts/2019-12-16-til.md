# What I did today
- I started TIL (Today I Learnt) today and I will keep doing it during this vacation.(I hope so.)
  
- I created the github blog by remoting the theme which was minimal-mistakes. 
  Because it looks simple and its README.md was so nice but I still have a problem with the post page unfortunately.
  The theme was not applied to that page. It just looks "text chunk" :(
  
  This website super helped me to make the github blog:[jekyll-remote-theme] (https://dreamgonfly.github.io/2018/01/27/jekyll-remote-theme.html)
  
  Also, I did not know that Google has fonts page and I learnt that I can use the website to upload the images.

  ps. Remoting theme was the easiest one of the ways to make blog for me.
  
 - I uploaded the instruction of Linear Algebra but I should connect Linear Algebra to the code.

 # What I felt today
 - I just recognise that the number of commits is kind of important. But I did it so many times unnecessarily...even for checking themes,
   which was actually given in README.md. I should read README.md carefully next time : (
 - I am a slow starter and it makes me bit anxious because I feel like I have to catch up many things..Even it took quite a long time to      create this blog..
 
 # What to do tomorrow
 - To study Real Analysis and Calculus (functions) part 1.
 - To understand the Edge Detection Tool(Java) codes.
 - To study RAC (Sequences and series) Week 1,2.
