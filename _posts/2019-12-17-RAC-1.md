###Syllabus

The calculus is one of mankindâ€™s most significant scientific achievements,
transforming previously intractable physical problems into often routine calculations. 
Although its roots trace back into antiquity, it was developed in the late 17th century by Newton,
when developing his laws of motion and gravitation, and Leibniz, who developed the notation we still use today. 

Analysis is the branch of mathematics that underpins the theory behind the calculus,
placing it on a firm logical foundation through the introduction of **the notion of a limit**.
This module introduces **differentiation** from **the rigorous point of view**. 
The notion of a function of a real variable and its derivative are formalised.
The familiar techniques and applications of differentiation are reviewed and extended. 

###This is a brief list of the topics to be covered in this module.

- The definition of a function.
- The definition of the limit of a function.
- The definition of a continuous function.
- The definition of the derivative of a function of one variable.
- Techniques of differentiation.
- Maxima, minima and points of inflexion
- Graph sketching
- 2-dimensional coordinate systems.

###AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

- State the definition of a function and related notions and be able to sketch graphs of functions of a real variable.
- Solve basic inequalities, including those involving quadratic terms and moduli.
- State the definitions of the limit of a function and of continuous function.
- State the definition of the derivative and calculate derivatives from first principles.
- Calculate derivatives of functions of a real variable using standard techniques.
- Apply differentiation in appropriate situations.
- Construct simple proofs from definitions and standard results.

###Set notation

In the mathematics, we needed the rigorous point of view because of infinity.
As the human are finite, it is difficult to get the infinity for us. 
For example, we have the expression 1/n and when n becomes the infinity, it converges to 0. 

Does it mean the expression 1/n becomes 0? or Is it the number which is a bit over 0? 

To  define the infinitesimal, the mathematician invented the Epsilon-Delta definition.
And using it, the notions such as the limit, the differential and integral by the limit
were been rigorous. This kind of flow is the feature of the initial mathematics.

Also, by the mathematicians, Georg Cantor who defined the infinity rigorously by systematising the set theory 
and Richard Dedekind who defined the Real number rigorously, the calculus became accelerated. 

Therefore, applying the pursuit of rigorousness to every field of the mathematics has been spreaded.
We can find the Calculus in Algebra, Geometry and Applied Mathematics.
